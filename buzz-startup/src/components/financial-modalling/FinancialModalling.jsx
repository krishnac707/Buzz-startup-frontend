                        in a startup. Quite often, convincing an investor is more about being influential,
                        passionate and bold about your business idea. Investors need to know that you, as
                        a business owner, will do everything you can to make the business work.</h5>

                <h5>Valuation is the process used to determine the value of the company. The most common
                    methods of valuation are DCF, which uses the free cash flows for the firm derived from
                    the financial statements, and Comparable Valuation which uses metrics such as sales
                    multiple and EBITDA multiple of similar companies and applies the same to the subject
                    company to determine it's value. When we look at investing in any company, it is very
                    important to understand that we are buying into the future and hence want to know the
                    future prospects of the same. This is very important for startups as we are looking at
                    value propositions on the basis of no history and hence the entire value is derived from the
                    future. Having worked with numerous companies, we provide guidance regarding various aspects
                    of projections and valuation to help you get your funding.
